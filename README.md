# Pig Game

This is a simple implementation of the Pig Game using JavaScript. The Pig Game, also known as "Pig Dice Game," is a two-player dice game where the players take turns rolling a die to accumulate points. The goal is to be the first player to reach a certain score (usually 100 points).

## Game Rules

1. The game has two players, Player 1 and Player 2.

2. On each turn, a player rolls a six-sided die and accumulates points based on the rolled number:
   - If the player rolls a 1, their current score is lost, and it becomes the other player's turn.
   - If the player rolls any other number (2-6), the rolled number is added to their current score.

3. The player can choose to "Hold" their current score, which adds the current score to their total score. Then it becomes the other player's turn.

4. The first player to reach the winning score (default: 100 points) wins the game.

5. Players can also start a new game at any time, which resets all scores and starts a new round.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Used for the structure and layout of the game interface.
- CSS: Used for styling and visual presentation of the game elements.
- JavaScript: Used for game logic and interactivity.

## How to Play

1. Open the game in your web browser.

2. The game will start with Player 1's turn. The active player is indicated by the highlighted player area.

3. Click the "Roll Dice" button to roll the die. The rolled number will be displayed on the die image, and the current score will update accordingly.

4. If you roll a 1, your current score will be reset to 0, and it becomes the other player's turn.

5. If you roll any other number (2-6), the rolled number will be added to your current score. You can continue rolling or choose to "Hold" your current score.

6. Click the "Hold" button to add your current score to your total score. It becomes the other player's turn.

7. Repeat steps 3-6 until one player reaches the winning score. The winning player will be highlighted, and the game will be over.

8. To start a new game at any time, click the "New Game" button. All scores will be reset, and a new round will begin.
